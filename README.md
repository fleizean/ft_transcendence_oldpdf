# ft_transcendence_oldpdf
Last common core project in my Ecole 42 journey. This project is a web application that allows you to play Pong online. With a ladder system, user accounts, spectators, two powerups, two maps, a real-time chat.


## Update
Unfortunately, we had to continue with the new pdf because our project friend could not keep up, so I will continue to keep my old backend codes here, let it be an example nestjs project. Maybe I will complete it in the future!
